    <h1>Jennifer Weiner - WordPress Wizard And Full Stack Web Dev</h1>
    <p>With 10 years of experience with WordPress, I decided to go to Lambda School to learn Full Stack Web Dev. My clients deserve the best sites. To provide that, I need some coding skills. I believe in going all in when learning something new. So Lambda was the best choice for me. No fluff, all coding.</p>

    <h2>A little of my story</h2>
    <p>Ive worked a little bit of everthing. From fast food to retail to telephone customer service, I've done it for at least a year.</p>
    <p>While I do love providing amazing service, working in WordPress for myself and family for 10 years gave me a clue that my passions lie elsewhere. Now, as I work through the Full Stack Web Development track at Lambda School, that hint is being fully validated. Seeing what looks like gibbersih to most people come to life in a web browswer makes me a happy as a child on their birthday!</p>
    <p>I'm excited to see where these new skills take me. From continuing to grow my current business to working for a start up or even a larger company, I know there's no limit to where I can go from here.</p>
